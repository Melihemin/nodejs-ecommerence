            <h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>WordPress is software designed for everyone with emphasis on accessibility, performance, security, and usability. We believe great software should work with little setup so you can focus on sharing  your story, product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable to easily get started, yet also offers a solid array of features for growth and success.</p>
        <p>We believe in democratizing publishing and the freedoms that come with open source. Gathered behind this idea is a large community of people dedicated to this project. The WordPress community is growing and inclusive. Their passion is what drives the success of WordPress and, in turn, helps you reach your goals.</p>

            <p>We work around the globe and have contributed countless hours to give voices to the voiceless and provide the chance to build a better future. WordPress is open source software that is both free and priceless.</p>

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>WordPress started in 2003 when Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg created a fork of b2/cafelog. The need for an elegant, well-architected personal publishing system was clear even then. Today, WordPress is built on PHP and MySQL and licensed under the GPLv2. It is also the platform of choice for over 29% of all sites across the web. </p>

            <p>WordPress is the success story of open source projects everywhere. Not only does it evolve in progressive ways -- supported by the finest engineers, designers, scientists, and bloggers the world has ever seen -- but it also  provides the opportunity for everyone to create and share, from hand-crafted personal anecdotes to world-changing movements. People with little tech background can use it out of the box, and the more tech savvy can use it in the most advanced ways.</p>
